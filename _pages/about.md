For a while I was thinking about jotting down my previous study notes for my own blog, after using Oracle's free server, which unfortunately was so slow, I decided to use GitHub Pages to host the website.

While doing some research on GitHub Pages, I stumbled upon this simple, blog-aware static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that works really well with GitHub Pages. So I started looking for a nice theme. Eventually I found this theme [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale). This blog is used to record my study notes. It has a very concise page. Thanks again to the original author for his help.
