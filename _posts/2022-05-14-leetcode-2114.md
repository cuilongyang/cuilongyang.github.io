[2114.LeetCode](https://leetcode.cn/problems/maximum-number-of-words-found-in-sentences/) A **sentence** is a list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single **sentence**.<!--more-->
Return the *maximum number of words* that appear in a single sentence.

Example:

```
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too"
, "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence 
comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
```
## Java Solution 

```java
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        if(sentences == null){
            return 0;
        }
        int index = 0;
        for(String string:sentences){
            int temp = string.split(" ").length;
            if(index <= temp){
                index = temp;
            }
        }
        return index;
